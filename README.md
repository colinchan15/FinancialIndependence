# Prism

Prism is a budgeting tool for Ontario University students. 

This tool estimates the approximate amount of time it will take for a student to pay off their current student loans based on their current assets. I wanted to build this because there always seemed to be a lack of information and confusion surrounding the topic of student loan repayment. I want to streamline and effectively communicate the steps that a student like me, with no real solid understanding of loans, would need to take in order to quickly and efficiently pay off their student loans. 

I began this project because I believe the presentation of convoluted data in a simple and concise way is beautiful, elegant, and most importantly, useful.

Project Timeline:
Early August 2018 - Started designing the initial idea of the project and what it should accomplish

Late August 2018 - Began developing and integrating front-end of project with the back-end using JavaFX
